    "\n",
    "Seattle is a city that has grown rapidly over the last decade.  From 2010-2018, the population of Seattle grew 22.4%, whereas the population of the United States grew 6.0%.  As the city continues to grow, it is important for potential business owners to examine the types of businesses in the area.  For example, a restaurant owner may not want to open a restaurant in a neighborhood that has many similar types of restaurants. To examine the types of venues in the area, Foursquare location data can be leveraged in order to select a neighborhood that is not saturated with a particular type of restaurant.  Analyzing median income can also be useful in determining price points for the menu. To explore different neighborhoods in Seattle, I will create a map of the neighborhoods showing median income and clustered by venue density."

    "Seattle neighborhoods are not official, and many of the boundaries are informal.  To examine neighborhoods and districts, I will be pulling in a GeoJSON map of the Seattle neighborhoods from the City of Seattle.  This file includes the smaller neighborhoods, larger neighborhoods, and latitude and longitude.  For this project, I will be focusing on the neighborhoods that are located near central Seattle.  In order to examine the neighborhoods, I will leverage Foursquare API data to retrieve the 20 most common venues of each of the smaller neighborhoods in Seattle.  I will then use a k-means algorithm to cluster the neighborhoods.  Examining the most common venues in the clusters, I can then identify appropriate neighborhoods for a restaurant.  I will also pull in data of median incomes by neighborhood.  By examining median incomes, this will help business owners decide reasonable prices."
